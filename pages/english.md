<p class="mission-statement" style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0;">
    Open Nederland is <em>the association</em> for organisations and individuals working on 'Open'.
</p>

We are a national network of makers, advisors, and entrepreneurs. From Open Source to Open Science, from Open Education to Open Design, and beyond.

Our goal is to create, use, support, and encourage 'Open' in its many forms for the public benefit. Open Nederland is also the official steward organisation (Chapter) of Creative Commons in The Netherlands.

> **Creative Commons** helps you legally share your knowledge and creativity to build a more equitable, accessible, and innovative world. We unlock the full potential of the internet to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity.
